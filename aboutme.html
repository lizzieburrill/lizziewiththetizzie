    <h2>The Diagnosis That Changed Everything</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Lizzie, and I found out I was autistic at 38 years old. That was in
      May 2025, and honestly? I’m still processing what that means for who I am
      and who I’ve always been. For 38 years, I thought there was something
      fundamentally wrong with me. I couldn’t understand why everything felt so
      much harder for me than it seemed for everyone else. Why social situations
      left me completely drained. Why certain sounds or textures made me want to
      crawl out of my skin. Why I needed so much more downtime than the people
      around me just to function. Turns out, I wasn’t broken. I was just
      autistic.
    </p>
    <h2>Life Before Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
      Before my diagnosis, I was the master of masking - I just didn’t know
      that’s what I was doing. I spent decades studying people like they were a
      subject I needed to pass exams in. I learned the “right” responses, the
      appropriate facial expressions, how to make small talk that didn’t feel
      natural but looked convincing enough. I became so good at performing
      “normal” that nobody, including me, realized I was performing at all. The
      cost of that performance? Autistic burnout. The kind where you come home
      from work and have nothing left - not for your partner, not for your kids,
      not even for basic self-care. The kind where showering feels like an
      insurmountable task because every ounce of energy went into maintaining
      that mask all day. I’ve lived through periods where I was functionally
      shutdown after work hours, going through the motions but not really
      present for my own life.
    </p>
    <h2>Who I Am Beyond The Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a wife and a mum. I work in HR Technology, leading teams that build
      systems to support people at work - and I’m particularly passionate about
      making workplaces genuinely inclusive for neurodivergent people. I lead
      our company’s Ability+ Community and neurodiversity network, which has
      taken on a whole new meaning since my diagnosis. I love food, travel, and
      discovering new experiences - though I’m learning that my idea of
      “discovering” might look different than the typical travel influencer’s
      version. Give me a detailed itinerary and familiar food options any day
      over spontaneous adventures.
    </p>
    <h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      This website is part of my journey to figure out who Lizzie actually is
      when she’s not masking, not performing, not trying to be anyone other than
      herself. It’s about unlearning 38 years of survival strategies and
      learning how to just… exist authentically. Some days that feels exciting.
      Some days it feels terrifying. Most days it’s a bit of both. But I’m done
      spending my energy pretending to be someone I’m not. There’s a freedom in
      finally understanding why I am the way I am - and in giving myself
      permission to be exactly that.
    </p>
    <h2>Why "Lizzie with the Tizzie"?</h2>
    <p>
      Because life can be chaotic, overwhelming, and yes - sometimes I’m in a
      bit of a tizzy. And that’s okay. That’s just part of being me. This name
      is me reclaiming language that might have been used to dismiss my very
      real experiences of overwhelm and turning it into something that’s
      authentically mine. Welcome to my journey. I’m figuring it out as I go,
      but at least now I’m figuring out the real me.
