        If you’re newly diagnosed or questioning whether you might be autistic
        or have ADHD, “Unmasked: The Ultimate Guide to Thriving with ADHD and
        Autism” by Ellie Middleton is essential reading. What makes this book
        brilliant is how well-organised and accessible it is - perfect for
        neurodivergent brains that need information presented clearly without
        overwhelming walls of text. Page after page felt incredibly relatable
        (so many “oh my god, that’s me” moments), and Middleton strikes the
        perfect balance between being positive and hopeful while remaining
        honest and sensitive about real challenges. I especially appreciated
        that she recognises intersectionality and acknowledges the experiences
        of those who are further marginalized beyond just being neurodivergent.
        This book feels like having a knowledgeable, understanding friend walk
        you through everything you wish someone had told you years ago - it’s
        the companion I needed when I got my diagnosis at 38.

        The Ono Roller is hands down one of the best fidget tools I’ve found for
        managing sensory needs and anxiety, especially during work meetings or
        moments when I need to self-regulate without drawing attention. It’s
        beautifully simple - a smooth, weighted roller that fits perfectly in
        your hand and glides satisfyingly across your palm, fingers, or even
        your desk. The tactile feedback is incredibly calming without being
        distracting, and unlike spinners or clicky fidgets, it’s completely
        silent, which means I can use it in meetings or calls without annoying
        everyone around me. The weight gives it a quality feel that cheaper
        fidgets lack, and there’s something about the repetitive rolling motion
        that helps ground me when I’m feeling overwhelmed or need to
        concentrate. It’s small enough to keep in my pocket or bag, durable
        enough to withstand constant use, and honestly? It’s become as essential
        as my phone - I genuinely feel a bit lost without it now.
