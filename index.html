      Navigating life, work and everything in between as a late diagnosed
      autistic woman. Because finding out at 38 that you're autistic changes
      everything and nothing all at once.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Lizzie. At 38, I received my autism diagnosis and suddenly my
      entire life made sense - all those moments of feeling different, all the
      masking, all the exhaustion that I couldn't quite explain. But a diagnosis
      isn't an ending; it's a beginning. This space is where I'm figuring out
      who I've always been underneath all those years of trying to fit in. I'm
      processing, learning, and discovering myself through a completely new lens
      - and I'm sharing it all because none of us should have to do this alone.
